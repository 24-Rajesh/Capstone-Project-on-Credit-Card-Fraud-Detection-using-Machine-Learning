# Capstone-Project-on-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning


# Problem Statement:

A credit card is one of the most used financial products to make online purchases and payments. Though the Credit cards can be a convenient way to manage your finances, they can also be risky. Credit card fraud is the unauthorized use of someone else's credit card or credit card information to make purchases or withdraw cash. It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. We have to build a classification model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

# Introduction:
In today’s world, we are on the express train to a cashless society. According to the World Payments Report, in 2016 total non-cash transactions increased by 10.1% from 2015 for a total of 482.6 billion transactions! That’s huge
Now, while this might be exciting news, on the flip-side fraudulent transactions are on the rise as well. Even with EMV smart chips being implemented, we still have a very high amount of money lost from credit card fraud
This is now becoming a serious problem since most of the time, a person who has become a victim of this fraud don't have any idea about what has happened until the very end. So in this project, what we have tried is to create a Web App for the detection of such type of frauds with the help of Machine Learning.In the following sections, we will be explaining about the creation and importance of
both a good Machine Learning model

# Context:

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

Content The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for

These are the steps that will be carried out in this project: Data Sourcing,Data Analysis,Model Building,Model Evaluation

We will also be creating an “evaluate_model” function that will be used to get the metric scores of our models for evaluation. The metrics used are: Accuracy Score: Accuracy is a metric used in classification problems used to tell the percentage of accurate predictions. We calculate it by dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions.
